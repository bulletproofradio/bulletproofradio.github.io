  <h4>Wayne Rock is the drummer of Bulletproof Radio.  He was born in London, England.  As a child he dreamed of travelling
"across the pond" to pursue his dream of becoming a rock star in America.  He got his start in several London based punk bands
as a teenager.  But he wanted more.  So when the oppurtunity to move to New York City knocked at his door, he quickly responded and
 relocated without looking back.</h4>
